## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CUBE CSS with Tailwind

### What I learned

I used this project to explore the CUBE CSS methodology more. I tried as far as possible to avoid media breakpoints and embrace intrinsic design. I was unable to fully achieve this so there are a few media queries still left, but they are mainly for minor tweaks.

This was my first time creating plugins for Tailwind. I used this to create utilities for the `stack`, `cluster` and `sidebar` components from [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/). I customized the Tailwind spacing and font-size scales to replace them with fluid scales using `clamp`
