## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CUBE CSS with Tailwind

### What I learned

I used this project to explore the CUBE CSS methodology more. I tried as far as possible to avoid media breakpoints and embrace intrinsic design. I was unable to fully achieve this so there are a few media queries still left, but they are mainly for minor tweaks.

This was my first time creating plugins for Tailwind. I used this to create utilities for the `stack`, `cluster` and `sidebar` components from [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/). I customized the Tailwind spacing and font-size scales to replace them with fluid scales using `clamp`
